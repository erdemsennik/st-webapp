I worked on several ".py" files but the last and used one is "capstone.py". 
I created virtual environment using anaconda, named enough. The included libraries in this virtual environmnet is inside the "libraries in the virtual env" file.
To deploy the web app, I used vs code.
Draft python file is capstone.ipynb.
